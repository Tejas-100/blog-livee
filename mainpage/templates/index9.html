								<p><b><i>How to stay focused while studying, a guide:</i></b></p>
								<p><i>1.<u> Find a suitable environment.</u></i><br>
									Location, location, location. Finding where you work best is an essential part of any successful studying session. For some, the quiet of a library is essential, but for others, the light bustle of a coffee shop can be just the right amount of background noise to stay focused. But whatever your background noise preference, it’s important that your study spot has a few things –<br>

									-->Flat, clear, surface with enough space to comfortably hold all your materials and laptop<br>
									-->Outlets – if you need your computer to study, ensuring you have a close power supply can prevent the need to get up and break your flow.<br>
									-->Comfortable seating (or standing place) – When selecting a place to work, it’s important to try and pick a place that has the necessary furniture to promote good posture for prolonged, sustainable studying.  Whether you use a comfortable desk chair with back support, an exercise ball, or standing desk, sitting upright has been shown to increase energy levels and confidence, as well as enhance overall mood. In addition, sitting in a slouched position can make your brain more predisposed to feelings of hopelessness.
								</p>
								<p><i>2.<u> Create a study ritual.</u></i><br>
									When it comes to staying focused while studying, it’s important to create a routine to help you find your flow and focus. A good place to start is having a pre-study ritual that involves things like clearing your desk, closing your door, grabbing all the materials you’ll need, putting on some headphones, and creating a to-do list. Taking five minutes to set up your workspace will not only physically prepare you to study, but also help train your brain to transition into a state of focus more effortlessly. With the space around you clear of distractions, your mind is free to focus on what is most important. Need some help structuring your ritual or routine? Check out how a morning routine checklist might help.

									<br>Is your work-from-home routine becoming a drag? Try switching it up. Start your mornings with a walk or just going outside for some fresh air and a glass of water – anything to help get your blood pumping and to let out any restless energy. Make your mornings or study sessions more enjoyable by adding activities you enjoy – journaling, dancing, lighting a candle, stretching, listening to a podcast. Regardless of the activity the key is to do it every time you need to study so your brain can more easily transition into focus mode.
								<p><i>3.<u> Block distracting websites + apps on your phone, tablet, and computer.</u></i><br>
									If you’re like most of us, distracting websites and apps can be the death of any productive, focused studying session. You sit down to study and before you can even begin, you get a notification or a headline catches your eye. Seemingly small distractions like these quickly steal minutes and then hours. On average, it takes 23 minutes to refocus on your work once interrupted.<br>
									Luckily, using a site blocker like Freedom can make all the difference. Freedom allows you to temporarily block distracting sites and apps across your Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Chromebook, and Linux devices. Select what sites or apps you want to block while studying, choose your devices, select for how long, and voila – all your worst distractions are blocked. With Freedom, you can even schedule recurring blocks that align with your scheduled study sessions to help make focusing a habit.
